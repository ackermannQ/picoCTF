Here, we have an image. It's kinda obvious considering the points gained in this challenge that it shouldn't be that difficult to get the flag.

First thing, taking a look at the image, seing no obvious flag, I started to think about changing the colors balance with Gimp.
However, before doing anything, I simply opened the file in an editor, finding at the end the flag :

picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y35a97d3bB}

The easiest way of hiding something is in plain sight, people will try to get an info from the part of the picture they can actually see. Instead, just having a little closer look at the "source" get us the flag !
